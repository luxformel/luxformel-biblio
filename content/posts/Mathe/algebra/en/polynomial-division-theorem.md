## Exercise 1 : Polynomial Long Division

Divide using polynomial long division.

1. $(x^2 + 5x + 6) \div (x + 2)$
2. $(2x^2 - 7x + 3) \div (x - 3)$
3. $(x^3 - 8) \div (x - 2)$

4. $(3x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x - 1) \div (x^2 - x + 1)$
5. $(x^4 - 16) \div (x^2 + 4)$
6. $(2x^4 - 3x^3 + x^2 - 5x + 2) \div (x^2 - 2x + 1)$

## Exercise 2 : Synthetic Division

Divide using synthetic division.

1. $(x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6) \div (x - 1)$
2. $(2x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x + 1) \div (x + 2)$
3. $(x^4 - 3x^2 + 2x - 5) \div (x - 3)$

## Exercise 3 : Remainder Theorem Applications

Use the Remainder Theorem to find the remainder.

1. $P(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 7$ divided by $(x - 2)$
2. $Q(x) = x^4 - 2x^3 + x - 5$ divided by $(x + 1)$
3. $R(x) = 3x^5 - 2x^3 + 4x - 1$ divided by $(x - 3)$

## Exercise 4 : Factor Theorem Applications

Use the Factor Theorem to determine if the given binomial is a factor.

1. Is $(x - 1)$ a factor of $x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 2$?
2. Is $(x + 2)$ a factor of $2x^3 + x^2 - 7x + 2$?
3. Is $(x - 3)$ a factor of $x^4 - 4x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 6$?

## Exercise 5 : Finding Roots

Find all real roots of the polynomials.

1. $P(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6$
2. $Q(x) = 2x^3 + x^2 - 13x + 6$
3. $R(x) = x^4 - 5x^2 + 4$

- Test each possible root
- Find all actual roots

1. $2x^3 - 3x^2 - 11x + 6$
2. $3x^4 - 4x^3 - 11x^2 + 16x - 4$

## Exercise 8 : Polynomial Equations

Solve the polynomial equations.

1. $x^3 - 3x^2 - 4x + 12 = 0$
2. $2x^4 - 5x^3 - 3x^2 + 5x - 1 = 0$

## Exercise 9 : Word Problems

Solve the following application problems.

1. The volume of a rectangular box is given by $V(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6$. If the height is $(x - 1)$, find expressions for the length and width.

2. When a polynomial $P(x)$ is divided by $(x - 2)$, the remainder is 5. When divided by $(x + 1)$, the remainder is -4. Find the remainder when $P(x)$ is divided by $(x - 2)(x + 1)$.

## Exercise 12 : Proof and Justification

Prove or justify the following statements.

1. Prove the Remainder Theorem.
2. Explain why synthetic division only works for divisors of the form $(x - c)$.
3. Show that if a polynomial has real coefficients and a complex root $a + bi$ (where $b \neq 0$), then $a - bi$ must also be a root.
